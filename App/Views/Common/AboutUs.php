                    <h4>Connecting Buyer, Seller, and Promoter together</h4>
                    <p>The main objective of this system is to create a platform where all Buyers,
                        Sellers, and Promoters can connect and communicate so that these parties in
                        our system can benefit themselves from each other.
                        Buyer, Sellers and Promoters are under our terms and conditions to keep
                        the system running consistently. Buyers interact with our system so that
                        they can purchase things that they see through social media.</p>

                    <h4>Allowing Small and Medium Sellers to create their own Mini Store</h4>
                    <p>We will be allowing Sellers who do not have an online store to create their
                        own Mini Store on our E-commerce site So that they do not only sell products online
                        but also have their own online store. In this Mini Store, we will only give a limited
                        number of design options, which will make their store unique. Also,
                        Buyers who come to a Sellerâ€™s Mini Store have the option of searching all
                        products under every Mini Store in our Affiliox E-commerce site.
                        Sellers will benefit considerably from having a Mini Store because then they
                        can brand their products with their store.</p>

                    <p>Social media users who have popular or regular accounts can register as
                        promoters in our System and earn money by promoting products. Through this,
                        people can use their social media existence as an income generation method.</p>
